# Weatherman â›…

A Weather App using React with a simple interface only showing relevant information. The application is intended to be light and minimal, with the only visual aspect that changes is the background animations.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Nivo, OpenWeather API, Styled-Components, JavaScript

I was looking to build a quick glance weather app similar to what Google has on their search engine. This was before knowing Gatsby which might have been a better pick for a single page app. I wanted to just build something with what I knew and figure things out along the way.

The OpenWeather API was pleasant to work with, even though searching with it only using a form sometimes yielded incorrect results. The data was mildly parsed and then sent to each separate component for further processing. There was a lot of data that came back from one query so I didn't want to deal with all of that in each component repeatedly.

The search box is custom and something I currently enjoy the look of. When clicked, it "opens up"; otherwise, it tucks itself back in till interacted with again. It might not be bulletproof but I created it myself even though I could have relied on some already made code.

What took a bulk of my time to implement was the graph from nivo. I used the line chart component from here. Getting the graph working took several small functions from the raw data returned from the OpenWeather API. Another thing I ran across while testing some locations by maintaining a graph even if some data isn't there.

## Optimizations

I had some ideas I wanted to implement given the time. The first would have been a dark mode. I've been seeing them pop up on several websites. Maybe even tie it to the system time and change the website dynamically.

I also wanted to work on better displaying the location a user searched. When searching for "San Francisco", the API brought back the country (US) rather than perhaps the state. I could have added another API to take care of this but I was worried about bogging down search speed.

## Lessons Learned:

Working with any API and getting data back is just the beginning. Molding that data into what you need takes a lot of trial and error. So many small functions to just get one piece working.

Another thing I had to consider was that sometimes an API wouldn't have the data you want. So error handling is a must. Might not be perfect but getting as many use cases patched up really makes the experience much nicer for the user.

I'm excited to revisit this site in the future and see what more I could add or even revamp the whole look to something more exciting! ðŸ˜€
